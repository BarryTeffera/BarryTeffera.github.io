									<p>This is an interactive dashboard that visualizes the publicly-traded U.S. stocks owned by Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger's holding company Berkshire Hathaway. It offers a Volume-Open-High-Low-Close chart with a drop down list of every stock greater than 1% on Berkshire's portfolio. Additionally, there are pie charts visualizing how Berkshire's investments are divided by industry and by company name. Separating the Volume-Open-High-Low-Close chart and the pie charts are a set of interactive slicers for Industry and each company's stock symbol. Finally, a horizontal bar chart shows each company's P/E ratio, followed by a vertical bar chart visualing the value of Berkshire's position in each company. </p>

									<p>This is a Coca Cola sales dashboard built with instruction from the Youtube Channel "Kenji Explains". Monthly sales are analyzed by Region, Retailer, and Brand. Both the Time Slider Widget and the map are interactive and filter upon use. Although this was a training exercise for me to develop the skills he was teaching, I made this project my own by changing the "Monthly Sales" chart to include a line graph that visualizes the rate of change in monthly sales.</p>

									<p>This Power BI dashboard was inspired by my experience with the Dataquest Fifa tutorial. This is my original design, an interactive dashboard showcasing the infamous "Pace Abuser" strategy on Fifa 22. Players from Europe's top 5 leagues with pace greather than or equal to 85, finishing greater than or equal to 85, and sprint speed greater than or equal to 80 were compared in tabular and cartesian manners. An interactive slicer lies on the far right, along with a count of how many of these players are in each league on the bottom. </p>

									<p>The 2022 soccer/football season brought us many qualified nominees for this year's "The Best" honor. Ballon d'Or winner Benzema and his French compatriot Mbappe had historic seasons for Real Madrid and PSG, respectively. Furthermore, Mbappe's hat trick in France's unsuccessful bid to retain the World Cup (WC) will go down as one of the greatest WC final performances of all time. In the WC's storied history, only Geoff Hurst managed to score a hat trick in the tournament's championship match (1966, England). However, the favorite for this prize was none other than the Argentine magician, Lionel Messi. His tenure at the top of world football is unparalleled and was accentuated by his rivalry with the enigmatic Cristiano Ronaldo. Messi's slow start to life at PSG decimated his chances at the Ballon D'or, but a strong start to his second season in Paris and a breathtaking WC run made him a shoe in for Fifa's award, which is voted on by each nation's coach, their captain, and a media representative. Fifa released the voting, which is visualized in this Power BI dashboard. An interactive map allows you to see the nationalities of each voter, along with slicers and various charts that emphasize just how dominant the voting for Messi was.</p>

									<p>Covid-19 Exploratory Analysis project with Alex the Analyst. In this project, data was collected from "Our World in Data", then cleaned and analyzed in SQL. A rolling count of the number of people vaccinated in each country was divided by the population of said country. This required data type conversions and basic arithmetic to be performed with the raw data. Furthermore, a ‘Common Table Expression’ (CTE) was used to accommodate references to the calculated column “Rolling People Vaccinated” for the final percentage. The data collected and explored in this project were then visualized in Tableau.</p>

									<p>This is a tableau visualization project I undertook with "Alex the Analyst". The Covid Data I used SQL to perform EDA with was extracted into excel and then visualized on tableau. Notably, "New Cases Worldwide", "Death Count per Continent", and "Percent Infected per Country" were analyzed. Furthermore, the "Percent Population Infected" and its projected forecast were visualized as well. A special thanks to "Alex the Analyst" for his tutelage.</p>
